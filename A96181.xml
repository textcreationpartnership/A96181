            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THis ſmall Manuall had neceſſitated me to an Apology, to excuſe my precipitance in adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing in publick, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb facs="tcp:170008:4"/> in this age, which ſo many Learned and Able Pens hath viſited; had not my paſſionate deſire to ſerve you, not only in the Pulpit, but in the Preſſe, not only by Supplications and Prayers, but by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, enforced this preſumption. It hath been the tedious controverſie and long diſpute of my thoughts, what teſtimony of my Love and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to preſent you with, and at laſt the vote
<pb facs="tcp:170008:4"/> carried it, to preſent you with a Landskip of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, I confeſſe, this ſmall Treatiſe cals for as many Apologies, as it hath lines in it ſelf, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſualneſſe of the ſubject, and your wonted favour and goodneſſe, ſhall be my Apologeticall plea. And as the Painter who pictured <hi>Alexander</hi> with his finger on his defective eye, let your candidneſſe cloud, and conceale all the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:170008:5"/> of it. What it is let me intreat you to entertaine and accept, and now it is come abroad into the world, let it not wander up and down and no man own it, but let it be ſheltred and received in the kind embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your patronage. This I muſt informe you, that my ambition to ſerve you was real and ſincere, though this ſhort Enchiridion be but a rude draught of that ambition. I ſhall not (my dear Friends and Flock)
<pb facs="tcp:170008:5"/> dilate, or digreſſe in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying of the ſeriouſneſs, profoundneſs, neceſſity and ſutableneſs of the argument, the great ſtate of <hi>Eternity;</hi> leſt I ſhould anticipate and foreſtall my ſelf, and leave the Treatiſe to be only a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall and repetition. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let not this ſuggeſtion be troubleſome and unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to you; if I mind you that <hi>Eternity</hi> is the end of all our hopes, the ſtage of all our duties, the ſhoar of all our labours, the reward
<pb facs="tcp:170008:6"/> of all our prayers, and the conſummation of all our happineſs. Man himſelfe was not created to live in a Cottage made up of lime and hair, of mud and dirt, to fix his thoughts or hopes upon fading and fainting enjoyments, but to be an inhabitant of and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidentiary in heaven where <hi>Eternity</hi> keeps the doore. The great Creatour of Heaven and Earth, is Mans only fit companion, and Eternity is eſſentiall to
<pb facs="tcp:170008:6"/> him, he is <hi>Deus aeternus &amp; immutabilis;</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Spirit are the ſouls onely refreſhments, and everlaſtingneſs is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed on them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16.

            <p> Let it not therefore (my endeared and Honoured Friends, and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 20. My glory, my joy) ſeem a tedious impertinency, or long digreſſion, to faſten your thoughts on <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> It may be (through grace, and it ſhall be my importunate prayer for you) ſome of you may bleſſe God for theſe few hints to <hi>all Eternity;</hi> Who <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 11.</note> knowes what a word in ſeaſon, if as a naile it be

Only let Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er uſher in, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany your Meditations on this Subject. I ſhall leave both the Treatiſe and You in the hands of the Lord, and intreat the God <note place="margin">Pſal. 65. 2.</note> that heareth Prayer, that every line in it may be written upon your ſoules in the bloud of Chriſt, and with the point of a

               <p>THis Chapter in the aime and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of it, is a Conſolatorie reſerve for ſuffering Saints; a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-cordial for fainting Martyrs; and it may be parcelled into four princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts.</p>
               <p>1. Here is <hi>Pauls</hi> vindication of his <note place="margin">The firſt part of the Chapter.</note> Miniſtery; and that in three regards.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:170008:14"/> 1. He advanceth his Miniſtery, by his call to it: by acknowledging free grace in calling him to ſo glorious a function. <hi>Paul</hi> chaines Miniſtery and Mercy together, and reads Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in his own function: a practice unuſuall with us, for we for the moſt part make the Miniſtery a cloth which will ſtain moſt, and eſteem that ſacred office, our miſery, not our mercy, our burden, not our priviledge; while we reproach the perſons, deride the qualifications, and diſpute the office of the Miniſtery; but this great Apoſtle makes that his honour, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute our ſcorn, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle magnifies his office by his ſincere carriage in it, and as he eyes Gods grace to him, in ſelecting him for this office, ſo he doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe Gods grace in him, in carrying him on in the office; he triumphs in Gods bounty and his own innocency. And truly ſincerity ſheds a gloſſe upon the Miniſtery, and dreſſes it in its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine attire; Miniſters ſhould no more want integrity in their office then qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications for it: the firſt obſtructing the prevalency, the latter underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanuing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170008:14"/> the dignity of the Miniſtery, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c. Paul</hi> was no daubing ſophiſter, who made the mine, and gain his end: who did adulterate the truth, to get a reall gain; he did not daub with untempered morter, nor preach <hi>fucatam</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 13. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Doctrinam,</hi> diſſembled and painted Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or vent truth in a duskiſh light; but he would weigh his intentions and practices, not in the ballance of his opinion, but in the ſcales of other mens conſciences: he preaches not himſelf, to make the Pulpit his pander; but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified: and if his own name muſt be mentioned, it was but as the cypher to the figure, to make Chriſt the more glorious, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Paul</hi> advanceth his office by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the truſt, that glorious truſt, that every Miniſter was entruſted withall, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. Miniſters they are conſiderable caskets, which contain rare jewels, as the matter of the Lamp to the light of it. As <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid to the trembling ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner, Thy boat carries <hi>Caeſar</hi> and all his fortunes: ſo the Miniſters they are the heralds of divine truth; and every one of them may juſtly take up <hi>Iſaiahs</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170008:15"/> Apologie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Woe is me, for I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, I am a man of unclean lips:</hi> pure truth drops from their unclean lips; and this is the firſt part.</p>
               <p>11. And as the firſt part comprizeth <note place="margin">The ſecond part.</note> the glory of the miniſteriall office, ſo the ſecond comprehends the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Miniſteriall officers: they are not only earthen, but battered and broken veſſels, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Paul</hi> and others they flamed in zeal, but many ſtormes fell upon the fire of their zeal; they were burning lights, but there were many winds to blow theſe lights out; the dignity of the office did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the miſery of the perſon; in the former part <hi>Paul</hi> admires his function, and in the ſecond he bewayles his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; Miniſters their calling is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, but oftentimes their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is deplorable; <hi>We are troubled, we are perplexed, verſ.</hi> 8. Indeed their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage is glorious, but their uſage is often grievous, and Chriſts Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 20.</note> often finde the ſame welcome with <hi>Davids:</hi> they are ſent out with renown, <note place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 4.</note> though entertained with reproach; they are ſtarres muſtled in a cloud:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170008:15"/> though the miſery mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. may be underſtood of the Saints in generall.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, there is a lampe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <note place="margin">The third part.</note> in this night; the third part of the Chapter comprehends the rare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of God, in providing planks for theſe ſhiprackt Miniſters and people, harbours for weather-beaten Saints, there were yet back-dores for ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned profeſſors, <hi>troubled but not diſtreſſed, verſ.</hi> 8. 9. and the voice of deſpaire was not heard in the ſtorme of their calamity, ſome twigs there were to keep them above weather; God hath either the caſtle of Providence, or the <note place="margin">Act. 23. 17.</note> arke of a Promiſe, or the alſufficiency of his own grace, for the retirement <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 8.</note> of his people in the greateſt ſtormes and tempeſts.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, here is mention made, of <note place="margin">The fourth part.</note> the glorious plot and deſigne that God hath in all the ſufferings of his Miniſters and people; and that is to bring them to glory at the laſt; the life of a Saint is a Tragicomedy; teares in the pilgrimage, but joy in the heritage;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170008:16"/> weeping in the bud, but glory in the flower; here perſecution, but ſhortly coronation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16, 17. The ſtripes of a Saint are eaſie, but the crown is weighty,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the maſſineſſe of it: much glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the value of it, and ſo I have now brought you within view of the text.</p>
               <p>And the whole verſe is the cloſe of the diſcourſe of this Chapter: and it is a ſerious Aphoriſme argumentatively uſed, to ſtay the minds of Gods people in all their infelicities, and to dry up all their tears: and the argument runs thus, That ſuppoſing our life here were ſpread with roſes, yet they are marceſſible; and if with thornes, yet they are dying; the jewels of the Crown will receive a damp, and the terrors of the Croſſe will ſoon be at an end: groanes and joyes in this life are both expiring, our troubles and our triumphs have their ſetting, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for the things that are ſeen are temporall;</hi> the diſtreſſes of the world are a ſhort and ſuddain tempeſt, and the delights of it are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170008:16"/> a ſhedding flower; and therefore the Apoſtles argument is, that there ought to be an indifferency in mens thoughts, for the outward paſſages of this world, wiſdome and grace ſhould make our judgments even, and we ſhould be in an <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> whether we ſway the ſcepter, or are caſt upon the dunghill, for all things ſublunary are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for a ſeaſon: but the things that are not ſeen, are eternall;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And now I have brought you within ſight of the vaſt Ocean of eternity, and the text is a pregnant argument that the great Apoſtle uſeth why we ſhould make it our inquiry, what our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated eſtate ſhould be; our future condition, when millions of years ſhall be as millions of cyphers, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing: when the Crown and the Croſſe ſhall be ſtretcht out to eternity, and there ſhall be neither fading in the one, nor waſte in the other. Now before I traverſe the doctrinall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that compriſeth the ſubject of the treatiſe, I ſhall unmaske the text it ſelfe in a percurſory explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and the queſtion will be what the unſeen things are in the text. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170008:17"/> firſt I ſuppoſe theſe unſeen things ſpoken of here, are principally thoſe fruitions of glory, which free grace hath ſtretcht out to eternity, that unſhaking and unſhaken crown of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; that everlaſting joy, that the Saints ſhall partake of; that unfading happineſſe they ſhall flouriſh in, to all eternity; that eternall houſe for the ſecurity of it, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5. 1. that eternall glory for the renown of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. that eternall inheritance for the riches of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. that eternall redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the love of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. that eternall ſalvation for the ſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. Theſe are thoſe unſeen things chiefly intended, thoſe glorious beatitudes which are reſerved for believers entertainment, which ſhall never receive either damp or death; thoſe rivers of pleaſure which run at Gods right hand <hi>for evermore.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 8.</note> And there are two reaſons which ſeem to enforce this interpretation:</p>
               <p>1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As the Text is a Cordiall: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing laid in by the Apoſtle to refreſh the fainting and languiſhing ſpirit of ſuffering Saints, and it is a rich one, and the argument will hold thus, In all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170008:17"/> your perplexities (ſuffering Brethren) do but weigh anchor, and ſail into the Ocean of eternity; and conſider, there your happineſſe ſhall never be blaſted, and the waſte of ages ſhall not precipitate the concluſion of your joyes: let this ſingle eternity, as it is put into the leaſe of your glory, revive your trembling and diſconſolate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when the ſtorme of trouble beats moſt upon you; And ſurely this very argument being weighed in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, might be bladders to bear up the believer in the deepeſt waters; it might as it were corke the ſoul, that it ſhould not ſink.</p>
               <p>And 2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this ſeems to be the genuine interpretation, becauſe there is a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant antitheſis obſervable in the verſe; temporals compared with eternals, fading ſorrowes with fixed joyes; our viſible martyrdoms are extinguiſhable fire, but our inviſible bleſſedneſſe ſhall be an unperiſhable crown, and ſo this verſe doth but ſecond and amplifie the former. But however this chiefly may be the expoſition of the text: yet I conceive that the unſeen things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the text may import and take in theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:170008:18"/> 1. The intereſt of man, we ſee not what the claime of man is here, many here are but Mountebancks and cheats in Religion, Alchymie profeſſors: mens ſpirituall eſtates are no more known by their outward profeſſion, then their temporall eſtates are by their cloathes; wherefore our conjectures are often miſtaken in our concluſion, what the intereſt of man is; whether their intereſt be laid up in Chriſt, or whether miſery ſhall be their portion. This may be one of the inviſibles in the text; but this unſeen intereſt in man ſhall be eternall, the Saints intereſt in Chriſt is eternall, his memberſhip, his relation, and the ſinners loſſe is eternall: the impropriation of man is eternall, their damage or their gain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtate of man is eternall; as the tree fals, ſo it ſhall lie to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, there ſhall be no ſtoppage to, or breaking up of mans future condition. We ſee not what the condition of man is here: but his eſtate ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly permanent; whether in the throne or on the wrack, eſtate of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity or calamity; his condition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170008:18"/> grace hath inamel'd it with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, or ſin inpoveriſht it with miſery, it ſhall be inalterably ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
               <p>And now at laſt I am arived at that concluſion or obſervation which ſhall be the ſum of the future diſcourſe; and it is this, <hi>Mans future condition is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condition;</hi> and I ſhall take in as well the groanes of hell, as the joyes of heaven; and now to unravell this bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe knot, or to ſound this fadom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Ocean of eternity, <hi>hic labor hoc opus eſt.</hi> This indeed is a conſtellation of difficulties, here the choiceſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may be dazled; eternity being a probleme, that may rather aſtoniſh, then fit the underſtanding: we cannot faddome the Ocean of waters, much leſſe that of eternity: but through the direction and by the guidance of the inviſible and eternall Spirit, I ſhall endevour to draw a map of this unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſtate, and give you a proſpect of this boundleſſe and bottomleſſe Ocean. And this I ſhall do rather negatively, then poſitively; as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Plat.</note> God, What he is (ſaith he) that I know not; but what he is not, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170008:19"/> I know. And as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> deſcribes <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> the true beatitude of heaven by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from it the very thoughts of all evill; ſo in reference to eternity, we muſt rather remove from it what it is not, then go about exactly and accurately to deſcribe it; that we ſhall only do when we are caſt upon the ſhoar of eternity. I ſhall ſet upon the enterpriſe in ſeverall Propoſitions and concluſions.</p>

In eternall calamity, there ſhall be no chirping birds, or green-livered fields to be the emblemes of an approaching Summer; hell ſhall not be gilded with a ſunſhining day. But eternity ſhall be an identicall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel;</hi> the interchangeable ſeaſons of the year ſhall ceaſe in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: the ſerenity and blackneſſe of the skies, the flouriſhing beauty and wither'd deformity of the earth, the eclipſes and changes of the celeſtiall bodies, the dawning morning, and the duskiſh evening, ſhall all be unknown in eternity. And an everlaſting night ſhall overſhadow the damned; and an eternall morning ſhall refreſh the

But this cannot take place in glory, when the Saints praiſes ſhall alwayes be in the ſame tune, and their hallelujahs ſhall be wound up as high as their joyes; nay their hallelujahs ſhall be part of their happineſſe. It is fancie, nay miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided conception, to ſuppoſe that the Saints in heaven could ſcrew up their harps to a higher peg then they ſhall do for ever: their deſires to ſerve God in glory, ſhall be-ſublimated to the ſame ſuperlativeneſſe as their rejoycing in God: Their love being perfect and their power, there ſhall ſurely be no decay in their triumphant obediencies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If there could be any gradation in heaven, then God did not fully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

               <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> One thing more may be added further to illuſtrate this truth, that <hi>ſecundum eundem</hi> in reference to the ſame perſon, there can be no degrees of glory; for then there would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in heaven comparatively,

               <p>Nor ſhall there be any degrees in their eternity of miſery, no aſcenſion to further eaſe, or deſcenſion to further miſery; (for the damned ſhall be fully miſerable) there ſhall be no ſlacking of the pullies or allaying of the flames; ſurely thoſe fires ſhall not decay in their force, that have the wrath of God for their fuell, and their bellowes. <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> fires, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 19. may <note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 33.</note> be colder or hotter according to the degree of the Kings diſpleaſure; but the infernall flames ſhall alwayes ſcorch with the ſame intenſive heat, God wrathfully kindling them, and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170008:24"/> Divell and his Angels rigorouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them. In the primitive times the tormentors were wearied in the execution of the Martyrs; but no ſuch happineſſe ſhall befall the damned, the juſtice and power of God being his nature, and ſo immutable; now there can be no degrees in the eternity of miſery.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the damned ſhall be puniſhed according to their capacity, they ſhall be full of torment, the veſſell of wrath ſhall be up to the brim in calamity. As the Saints ſhall enjoy fulneſſe of joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. So the reprobates ſhall be filled with fulneſſe of wrath and the degrees of torment in hell ſhall not ariſe from this, that any ſhall have a mitigation of their miſery, but every one ſhall be full of torture, but their gradualneſſe. Their more tolerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 15. ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacity of the damned, ſome of their natures ſhall be ſtretcht wider then others to receive more in, as a tun containes more then a firkin, but their miſery ſhall be coextentive to their capacity. They ſhall be full of anguiſh and pain, as the Ocean is with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170008:25"/> water, as the Fountain is with ſtreams; and it muſt be ſo, elſe there would be ſome alleviation in hell, ſome comfort, and mercy; the reprobates are not in ſo dolefull a condition as they might be, they might be worſe, and this would be ſome refreſhment; but alas! mercies ſmile ſhall not be ſeen in hell: <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, Mat.</hi> 25. 41. The ſound of Gods bowels ſhall not be heard there. In miſerable eternity the Reprobate ſhall reape no more, then the fruit of a divine execration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The damned ſhall be puniſhed for ever according to demerit, which is from adequate and proportionable juſtice; and therefore there is mention made of many ſtripes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 47. where we may obſerve the juſtice, and regular proceedings of God.

Now this would argue a falling ſhort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which heaven is uncapable of. Could the glorified Saints grow in grace, as they muſt if they riſe to higher
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170008:31"/> happineſſe according to Gods juſtice; then was there a deficiency in their grace before, which is anomalus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate perfection; and glory ſignifies no more but grace maturated to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: And therefore there can be no change for the better; becauſe there can be no cauſe for this change, eſpecially after the reſurrection, when the Grand aſſiſes are over.

               <p n="2">2.

Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, This change muſt be <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorem partem,</hi> for the worſe; there muſt be a fall in the Saints glory: which would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nforce theſe two abſurdities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Saints in glory were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of defaulting, for what can indam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage them but ſin? God who is pure juſtice inferres no prejudice upon the Creature, but as provoked by ſome criminall miſcarriage; if otherwiſe, then Gods juſtice might be impeached, which is moſt blaſphemous. Now that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170008:31"/> no impurity can ſtain heaven is moſt <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 9.</note> clear, as from the immediate preſence of God, which glorifies the Saints, not only with perfection of happineſſe, but of purity alſo; or elſe perfection was <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 27.</note> but a titular perfection, it were but nominall, were it not ſpotleſſe; and ſo likewiſe from that conſummate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which the Saints are arrived at in glory, which cannot retre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> backe again to any the leaſt preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication. For herein lies the difference between created perfection, that which <hi>Adam</hi> was enricht with before his fall, and the perfection of glory; the one includes, the other rejects all mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Could there be a change for the worſe in glory, then heaven would be a place of punitive juſtice; for all <note place="margin">Rev. 7. 16.</note> deteriority and dammage that befals man, is the iſſue of Gods afflictive and caſtigatory juſtice; but that is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for in eternall happineſſe there ſhall be nothing appearing but ſmiles, love, and indulgence. And as in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the day of grace and favour is paſt to the reprobate ſinner, ſo the day of correction and diſpleaſure is blown
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170008:32"/> over to the glorified Saint, In glory the leaſt heat of anger ſhall not appear in the face of God; nor ſhall the ſword of vindicative juſtice be bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſht there: I ſpeak after the manner of men.</p>
               <p>And ſo on the contrary, there ſhall not be the leaſt change in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the damned: For the worſe they cannot, for they ſhall be fully mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, (as before hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated). Nor for the better: for this change would either proceed from Gods pity, or mans piety.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from Gods pity, now God will ſhew no pity in hell. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hell is a place of pure juſtice, and exact ſeverity; no mitigation or favour in eternall miſery; could one drop of mercy fall into hell, it would alter the very propriety of it. <hi>Dives</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5 26.</note> in hell begs a drop of water, but a <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 24.</note> drop, the ſmalleſt meaſure, and of water, the moſt common element, Natures common bounty; yet in hell, there is no conceſſion to ſo reaſonable a petition. Mercies ſweet voyce ſhall not be heard among the damneds groanes. And</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:170008:32"/> 2. The day of grace is paſt; when once the ſinner is ſet on the ſhoare of eternity, offers and overtures of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and peace are then buried in ſilence. Sometimes the climacterical year of a <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 42.</note> Sinner is paſt before, but alwayes then. There ſhall be no mercy, after the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of mercy, more then the ſhadowes of the night can counterfeit the light of the day; here is the day of ſalvation, which when once blown over, the day of love ſhall break no more. And</p>
               <p n="3">3. What ſhould move Gods pity in hell?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The cries of the damned; they ſhall exalt his juſtice; not move his compaſſion; the horrours and the lamentations of the damned, ſhall be the very <hi>muſicke</hi> of Gods juſtice, the <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 26.</note> heraulds of his righteous ſeverity; <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 12.</note> here <hi>Ephraims</hi> moaning turnes Gods <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 20.</note> bowels within him; but the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates groanes ſhall only tune his juſtice. Or</p>
               <p n="2">2. Shall the ſinnes of the damned move God to compaſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtir up pity, becauſe they are great? Surely ſin is the fuel of wrath, not the argument of commiſeration,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170008:33"/> and grief and guilt ſhall be the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates livery for ever. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, as not from Gods pity, ſo neither from mans piety, ſhall any change ariſe in the eternity of the damned. They ſhall not be refreſht with mercy, or their condition ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an alleviating change, from any converſion to God, penitency for ſin, &amp;c. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. This piety, had it been true, or could it be ſo, it had never come to hell, nor could it lie there. True grace is no Salamander to live in the fire of hell, no flower to grow in that ſtench; the fruit of the Spirit ſhall not lie in the womb of eternall miſery; that <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> grace which is honoured with the name of divine nature, cannot be the ſubject of eternall divine wrath. Had they been, or could they after death be really pious, they ſhould not be eternally calamitous; the leaſt degree of true grace ſeales Chriſt and heaven to the ſoul, Weak faith, ſaint love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this piety be falſe, as all tears in hell ſhall be; for the weeping of the damned cannot be ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170008:33"/> but only a watery deſperation, an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of themſelves ſteept in tears; then this diſſembled mourning, is a provocation, not a mitigation, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame not appeaſe Gods wrath; and certainly all the ſelf-condemnations of the miſerable reprobate proceeds not from a deteſtation of ſin, but a deploration of their torment. And therefore now, to ſum up the whole, this remains unfallibly true, There ſhall not be the leaſt alteration or change in our everlaſting conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Hell ſhall be the grave of all the reprobates hopes. Here indeed all hope was not ſmoothered and evaporated; they had a reconcileable God. Gods bowels <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> were not totally reſtrained, but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance might have enlarged them, the treaſury-door of mercy and grace was not lockt up, but faith could have opened it, and the oyle of grace might have procured the oyle of gladneſſe; and there was ſtill a blanck in the leaſe for the ſinners name to be put in upon converſion to God. <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 1.</note> But in the eternity of the damned, every door of hope is ſhut and lockt up, and all expectation of change or compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be ſilenced.

And the damned ſhall be overwhelmed with curſed deſperation, as full of torment, as void of comfort and hope for evermore; the wretched deſpaire of <hi>Judas,</hi> being the monſter his exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate conſcience brought forth, was but a ſad embleme of the Reprobates condition in eternity, when they ſhall lie in an hopeleſſe, helpleſſe, endleſſe, eaſeleſſe condition of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to all everlaſting.

Indeed happily they were inflated with preſumption here; and their hearts were deluded into a vain dream of future glory: but their ſoules were never winged with true hope, it may be with the blaze of hope, but not with the grace of hope. They never were raiſed with the <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> expectation of faith; and the reaſon is, becauſe they never had any intereſſe in Chriſt, which is <hi>objective,</hi> objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſumme of all true hopes. Nor <note place="margin">Col. 1. 27.</note> was their hope faſtned to, or fixed upon a promiſe; for they had no title to a Goſpell-promiſe. Indeed all the hopes and expectations of a ſinner here; they are but the ebullitions of fancy: an anchor in the water; both uſeleſſe, and ridiculous. And if their hopes were but counterfeit coyne, and alchymie expectation here, what ſhall their hopes be in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eternity, when they ſhall be out of ſight of the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</p>
               <p>

               <p n="1">1. The greatneſſe of their torment;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170008:44"/> this is but commenſurate to regular juſtice; their inexpreſſible miſeries are but the execution of Gods juſtice, which is eſſentiall to the divine nature; and which after this life is inexorable; the very miſeries of the reprobate ſhall be the glory of Gods righteous ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the very flames of hell (as I may ſay) ſhall caſt a light on divine juſtice; Gods compaſſions in eternity are ſeal'd up to reprobate ones.

               <p n="2">2. Shall the duration of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fill the reprobate with hope?

All the ſighs, and weeping duties of Gods people, which with ſo much fervency and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie have been acted, ſhall expire when the Saints ſhall be caſt upon the ſhoare of eternity.

The formaliſts teares, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended heart-melting, commenced only to be the unhappy harbingers of ſome ſinfull policy, or to captivate the opinion of the vulgar, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect generation; their <hi>Jehues</hi> zeal, and <hi>Jerebels</hi> faſt; all their miſguided charity, and vainglorious almes; their extrinſecall duties, thoſe blazing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets of their profeſſion, ſhall all fall, and be ſwallowed up in eternity; and

               <p>1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> There cannot be any perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duty in the eternity of the bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Becauſe, Duty is <hi>via ad regnum,</hi> the way to the Kingdome: It is ſweat in the vineyard. It is <hi>motus ad finem,</hi> a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the end; and while we are in <note place="margin">Bona opera ſunt via ad regnum, etſi non cauſa regnandi.</note> ſervice, we are ſtill in motion, on this ſide reſt. All duty hath an eye to reward. Prayer and Meditation are but their rowing towards heaven; but heaven is the reward its ſelf: while we are upon the ſea of Ordinances and <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 21.</note> Duties, we are not come to the ſhoare: but heaven is a place of wages, not worke; the wearing of the crown, not the bearing of the croſſe. Here is <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>pugna,</hi> the fight; but above <hi>victoria,</hi> the conqueſt. Indeed the ſweeteſt duties, and the moſt intimate, even cloſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, is but the riſe to the crown, but heaven is the crown it ſelfe. Ordinances and Duties are but the ſoules flight to glory, but heaven is the habitation of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:170008:47"/>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In all Duty there is imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>aliquid infectivum, &amp; aliquid defectivum;</hi> ſomething polluted, and ſomething de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. Our moſt ſublime and ſpirituall <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 10.</note> duties are not wound up to command. They are all tainted with diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the rule. As the Moon it ſhines in a lower chamber inferiour to the Sun. And not only ſo, but our choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt <note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 6.</note> ſervices are beleapered with many ſpots; like the Moon in this regard too. But in heaven there is all purity, all fulneſſe, all perfection. No inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quateneſſe or diſproportion; no taint or pollution inhabits glory; and therefore duties are obſolete in eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Heaven ſhuts out anomalies, and mutilated performances. It is true, here, the Saints double-refined duties are ſent up to heaven with a gale of complaning ſighs, but that ſuch winds ſhould blow in glory, is an abſolute inconſiſtency.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> All our duties and ſervices, they are ſtill looking upon God, <hi>e longinquo,</hi> a far off. They look on God at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Prayer looks up to a Majeſty above; and hearing receives a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from the Court above. All our
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170008:48"/> duties are but traffique with heaven. But now in the eternity of the bleſſed, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 12.</note> the Saint lies in the embraces of God, hath him in his eye, in his full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: All our performances here, as emblems of ſubjection, look on God in a perſpective, they are proſtrations before a Majeſty above. There is the diſtance of heaven between the ſmiling God, and the praying Saint; and though he ſtand on tiptoe on the mountain of meditation, yet God is infinitely above him. Indead in duty the ſoul is <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> ſaid to draw nigh to God, yet ſtill there is a curtain between God and it, which death can only draw, and a vail which only the diſſolution of the believer can take away. But in glory there ſhall be the cleareſt viſion, the higheſt, and entireſt fruition, without the interpoſure of darkneſſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And there all the applications of the Saints ſhall be inhanced into a beatificall viſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> All our duties and ſervices imply a want and exigency. Prayer waites a return, and is the ſouls trade to heaven, for ſome commodity that is lockt up in Gods treaſury. Nay
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170008:48"/> when returnes do come, then new wants are created. Our dayly bread cals for dayly prayers. Every day ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth prayer with new matter of petition. But in eternity all wants are ſwallowed up in tranſcendent abundance: there ſhall be torrents of delight, and ſatisfaction, as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall <note place="margin">

And ſo likewiſe Sermons, Hearing, Meditation, they all imply a duskiſhneſſe in the underſtanding; and that the ſcales of ignorance are not fallen from the eye of the mind. But there ſhall be in heaven a fulneſſe of knowledge, as well as of joy; and the minde ſhall be as full of light, as the heart of joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> All duties and ſervices are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by precepts, and winged by promiſes; precepts muſt guide, and <note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 20.</note> promiſes bribe duty. All our ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are directed by the line of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 14.</note> and incouraged by the love of a promiſe. But in the eternity of the Saints, both precepts and promiſes ceaſe; for in glory there can be no irregularity, and therefore no need of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170008:49"/> a precept; and all promiſes are turn'd into accompliſhment. Commands they are the rules of unbridled nature; but they are ſuperfluous to nature, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in glory: to turn to God, waſh our hearts, bath our ſelves in peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall tears; theſe are anomalies and abſurdities in eternity. Promiſes they are ſpurs to ſluggiſh nature: but to the Saint glorified, they are ſuperva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caneous incentives. God in glory ſhall be in ſtead both of precept and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; he ſhall then guide us by his eye, not his ſcepter; and ſhall give us himſelf, not his bond in a way of promiſe.

There is nothing of duty in <hi>Dives</hi> his <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 24.</note> petition; the tears of the damned ſhall be only the exertions, and ebullitions of torment; the fruit of their miſery, not their love.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Hell is no place for duty; Who can look for ſervices to God, among the cries, ſcritches and extremities of the damned?

And all the cries which the damned make are to God as their tormentour, not their Soveraign. They would cry as much to Satan, would he burne with a cold iron.

               <p>AND here lies the great riddle of eternity, that time never waſts (I ſay time, though it be an improper locution, there being no time in eternity) and that after millions of ages are paſt over, there is not the thouſandth part of a moment ſpent; When there are as many cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies and ages ſpent, as there are drops in the Ocean, or ſtarres in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or haires upon all the heads that are, or have been in the world ſince the Creation; yet then there is not one flying moment blown over; the taper of eternity ſpends not, nor doth duration ſhed or fade at all.

After the damned <note place="margin">Mar. 9. 46. 48.</note> have tumbled on flames a tedious night of ages, it is as far from morning, as the firſt moment. Could we ſum up all thoſe years which thoſe Patriarchs of old ſpent, mentioned in the 5. of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> when their lives were ſtretcht out to ſo many centuries; and their glaſſe was ſo long in running, and hoary age ſo ſlowly ſeized upon them; I ſay, could we digeſt ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years into one totall ſum: nay, <note place="margin">

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Sometimes the Antients have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared eternity to the Sun, which keeps a conſtant courſe, and hath its unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted revolutions; which courſes the world, and every day returnes to its due, and wonted ſtation: The Sun winds about, and fetches its large and vaſt circuits; and keeping an even, though ſwift pace, it returnes at ſuch a term of time unto the ſame ſtage from whence it took its riſe: and therefore our predeceſſours obſerving the ſtedineſſe and conſtancy of the Suns motion, have made it the bright em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of eternity.</p>
               <p>But the Sun doth not paint out eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Sun hath its eclipſes, its clouds, its various aſpects: So that I
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170008:76"/> may ſay, Mutability is one beam of the Sun. The hiſtorian reports that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Procopius,</hi> and from him <hi>Pedro Mexia</hi> about <hi>An.</hi> 540.</note> the Sun gave not more light then the Moon, for almoſt one whole year in <hi>Italy,</hi> the skie in the mean time being clear and without clouds, or any thing to ſhadow the ſame. Thus the Sun is an alterable body. Nay in the very motion of it, which is chiefly the embleme of eternity, there hath been <note place="margin">Joſh. 10. 13.</note> ſtoppages and ſtayes, and retrograda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And the Scripture hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <note place="margin">Amos 8. 9.</note> a doom upon its glorious <note place="margin">Joel 2. 31.</note> body, that it ſhall it be turned into darkneſſe, and be entombed in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. But now eternity, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, invariable ſtate (as before): there ſhall be no eclipſe in glory, nor ſuſpenſion of happineſſe; joy in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhall <hi>never stand ſtill,</hi> or run re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde. God himſelf who is the Saints Sun in heaven, is eſſentially immutable. No beames of light ſhall viſit hell: nor clouds or eclipſes darken heaven. There is too much variation in the Sun, ſo that it ſhould paint out eternity.</p>
               <p>2. But further, there are many things conſiderable in eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170008:77"/> the duration which the Suns mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to be the emblem of. There is immutability, ſuperlativeneſs, voydneſs of ſucceſſion, joy, torment, the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and varieties of both. Eternity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth more in the womb of it, then duration let out for ever, eternity is but as the cipher added to the ſum of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe or calamity, it is alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate of felicity or miſery. It is not a naked abſtractive duration; but is a concrete, in its ſignificancy; and there is a great difference between the ſtate and duration of eternity; What ſhall we be, and how long we ſhall endure, they are 2. Queſtions. And all theſe emblemes do but paint out the bare continuance of eternity. A line of ages that hath no end.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall be a generall anſwer to all the emblemes conſidered com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexively, and together: <hi>viz.</hi> That all theſe creature-repreſentations, they are at the great day diſſoluble; the heavens ſhall paſſe away, and the <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 10.</note> element ſhall melt with fervent heat. The Phoenix aſhes ſhall be ſcattered, and the Ring ſhall be melted in the generall conflagration; but the great
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170008:77"/> aſſizes ſhall but open the curtaines, and ſee the generall alarme of eternity: Men <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note> dying before are gone to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar eternities: but after the grand and univerſall tryall, when every thought ſhall be anatomized, and chined up, then nothing ſhall appear but <hi>eternity:</hi> And all the rivers of times ſhall be ſwallowed and drowned in that Ocean. All perſons then ſhall ſail for ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea of joyes, or calamitous eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. After the day of judgement, all ages and centuries ſhall be fledged and leave the world, which ſhall be remaining; and the particular parcels of Time, ſhall be all ſummed up in the totall of Eternity. So that now theſe emblems which repreſent eternity, themſelves ſhall have an end; ſo that they are rather the ſhadowes, then repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of eternity.</p>

               <p>THere is no ſounding of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, after we are lanched into the Ocean of eternity; then there is no ſetting us a ſhoar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to re-act a new life in the world. When once the trap-door is let down upon us, there is no break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Fugit irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile tempus.</note> that priſon-door; when we have once paſſed through that darke entry, and ſhot that inevitable gulf; there is then no more retirement back again from behind thoſe darke hangings to viſite the ſhoar of the world. Eternity locks up all back-doores againſt them that are caſt upon that condition; and prevents all poſſibilities of flight or eſcape. Chriſt and his Apoſtles raiſed <note place="margin">Joh. 11. 44.</note> indeed many from the dead, but it was <note place="margin">Act. 20. 12,</note> in an extraordinary way, and their graves were forced open by the petarre
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170008:78"/> and engine of a miracle. Eternity, whether it lands its paſſengers upon the ſhoar of glory, or locks them up in the dungeon of miſery, it makes their condition equally irreverſible. Death is not a dream or a ſwoon; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Facilis deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Averni; Sed revocare gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus eſt.</hi> Virg.</note> nor in this regard a ſleep, to be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again in this life; but when once it hath cloſed the eyes of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted patient, the deccaſed bids an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting farewell to all things here below; and enters upon a new but never ending condition. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his diſciples ſpeake much of a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a tranſmigration of the ſame ſoul into many bodies; and that death only cauſeth the ſoul to change its tenement and habitation; but yet in this dream there is no mention made of the ſame body to be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again, and reflouriſh in this life by a new reſurrection. When the ſoul in death takes its flight, and leaves its loving mate the body, it ſhall meet no more with it, till the day of the generall Aſſizes. The arreſt of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as it will not take bale, ſo neither will it ſuffer any evaſion. Let not the voluptuous ſinner pleaſe himſelf with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170008:79"/> a vain dream, that after death he ſhall return again, and gratifie his ſenſuall luxuries; his palat ſhall be downe in the grave; and being thrown into the Ocean of eternity, he ſhall get up above water no more. We may meet with <hi>Dives</hi> in the flames of death; but no <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 23.</note> more at his banquets: the <hi>Zelanders</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 19.</note> motto, <hi>Luctor, &amp; emergo,</hi> I ſtrive, and get up, is a paradox in eternity. And what ſhould make eternity caſt its captives again upon the ſhoar of the world?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſinners ſinfulneſſe cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit a relaxation, or a regaining of his liberty; when the ſoul by death, elapſed from the body, and fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to torment, ſhall blaſpheme God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated by that miſery it is tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in; how can juſtice it ſelf give that damned ſoul a diſpenſation for a re-entry in its body again? And</p>
               <p n="2">2. So likewiſe the Saints, when death hath broken the fetters of all their miſeries here, and the grave hath ſwallowed all their moans and feares: how ſhall they return, to react all thoſe tragedies, and martyrdomes, they broak through in this life? <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 22.</note>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170008:79"/> Gods paternall indulgence will not ſuffer them to put to Sea again.

Imagine once more, ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of millions of years, as there are drops in the Sea, and thou are not come to the very beginning of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is inconſiſtent to the merits of Chriſt.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170008:96"/> of his people neceſſitate him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it? Now all theſe rarities are but branches from the ſame root of love. Ah! how tender, gratious, ſpirituall, pretious, ſuperlative, conſtant and beatificall is the love of the Lord Jeſus to his people in this life! And ſhall his love to his Saints in glory faint, or be eclipſed with a wane or decay; when now he hath his people in his own embraces? Can no miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, relapſes, and failings quench the flames, or ſtop the ebullitions of Chriſts love to his people here, and ſhall a languor or dampe ſurpriſe it, when they are purged from all ſpot and wrinckle, and ſhine in the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 27.</note> beauty of purity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us conſider, that in heaven Chriſt enjoyes the fruit of all his love; the birth of his death, the iſſue of his bloud, the reſult of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the muſick of his groans, and that is, he ſees his own ſpouſe, his Saints enthroned in glory. The end of all his paſſions, and of all the Saints afflictions, the ſcourge he endured, and the rods they often lie under; was
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170008:97"/> glory at the laſt. And now after the travell of his foul, and the tryall of theirs, they are arrived at heaven, ſhall the pulſe of his affection beat faintly, or his loves be ſurpriſed with decay? In heaven our marriage with <note place="margin">Rev. 19. 7.</note> the Lambe is conſummated when we are entred into the bride-chamber, and ſhall the wedding day, (for the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of glory, are but an eternall wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day) ſlacken, or invalidate the tranſcendencies of Chriſts affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>

               <p>Let us but take a ſhort view of the fooliſhneſſe of moſt men, how fooliſh creatures they are; how ready and eaſily willing to forfeit and loſe their ſeaſons. Man in his infancy ſaith, It is not yet time to thinke of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, I am but a bud newly viſible in the bloſſome, in the immaturity of my age; I have taken newly a leaſe of this life, (Infant, let me tell thee, thou haſt none) I am newly come upon the ſtage of the world, and therefore to vex or diſcompoſe my thoughts with a future eternity, is not a duty but a ſoleciſme; thus man in his unripe years lockes out the thoughts of an everlaſting condition. And man in the beauty of his youth, he ſuſpends his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170008:117"/> thoughts of eternity; leſt thoſe grave and ſerious contemplations might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter thoſe pleaſures he drenches him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in; he ſhuts out thoſe unwelcome <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11. 9.</note> gueſts which would interrupt the harmony and muſick of his mirth. The young man he conjectures that to think of eternity is a <hi>hyſteron proteron,</hi> and ſo he looks on it as a vain anticipation; it is too ſoon in the morning of his age, to think of the evening of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And man in his full age, looks on himſelf, as too ſtrong and vigorous to fall into eternity, and in his own vain preſumption, ſuppoſeth that he could wreſtle with, and foil death it ſelf; his veins are full of bloud; his bones are full of marrow, his body is full of ſtrength, and he prides himſelf in the encraſie and healthful temperament of his conſtitution; and therefore for him to think of eternity, is to caſt himſelf upon an unſeaſonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary toil: thus the ſtrong man bolts all ſuch meditations out of door. Nay man in his old and decrepit <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Avaritia ſene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuti naturalis.</hi> Ariſt.</note> age, when he feebly and faintly walks upon the crutches of decay; he is then more agglutinated and chained to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170008:118"/> the world, how tenacious are then his deſires, ambitious his purſuites, and how cloſe his embraces of the things of this life; and when his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> as well as his ſin lies at his door, how doth he baniſh eternity out of all his thoughts, and makes his brain but a Mine of dirty contemplations? Thus all ages of men look upon the ſerious, ſolemne and ſober thoughts of eternity, but as a piece of unſeaſonable melancholy, and overbuſie intruſion into their otherwiſe-imployed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. And ſo poor man is ſwallowed up in eternity, before he hath ſeriouſly conſidered it: the poor Ant guided only by a ſenſuall inſtinct, thinks of a future winter, and ſo accordingly prepares and layes in for it; ſhall the Ant thinke on a winter, and not thou ſtupid man on eternity, the never ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, never failing or ending eſtate of thy ſoul? as the wiſe man ſaith, Learn policy and wiſdome from <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 6.</note> the poor Piſmire.

               <p>There are two things amplify the riches of grace, and ennoble it to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable value: The Divinity of its <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> nature; and the eternity of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for grace cannot be annihilated,

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170008:134"/> as one in the Primitive times. Eternity would make zeal leap in the wombe of duty. And it is worth our conſiderations, What a ſhort breath, would our duties be, were our life but one conſtant ſervice?

As <hi>Archimedes</hi> who was ſo intent on his Mathematicall ſtudies, that he heard not the Souldiers when they came to his ſtudy-door to kill him. Ah! what intention, heat, bent and abſtraction of minde would theſe contemplations produce?

               </argument>
               <p>WEE muſt look upon death, as the common paſſage, as the Poſterne gate to eternity, the Straights to the Ocean; the Heathens they fancied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning death, that after death there was <hi>Charon</hi> to waft them over the River <hi>Styx,</hi> &amp;c. But this is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <note place="margin">Mors eſt vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum morien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> that death only lands the ſoul upon the coaſt and ſhoar of eternity, it is only the ſhort bridge to an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting condition. It is but the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of eye when man dies, but he

               <p>Indeed, ſome mens paſſage is more rough then others; ſome men die with more torment, and pain, and diſtemper then others, but yet death is but the common road to eternity. It is ſtrange to obſerve what notions moſt men have of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Some look upon death as the <hi>debt of nature,</hi> that common engagement <note place="margin">Job 1. 1.</note> which every one muſt diſcharge, and <note place="margin">Job 14. 14.</note> for which death will arreſt every one of us. And ſo men ſuppoſe that having paid the debt, they are clear for ever, as if there were no <hi>eternity</hi> behind the hangings. And therefore they pant not after a Chriſt, nor ſearch the rols of heaven for a pardon, nor wreſtle with God for a ſmile; but conjecture that ſurrending according to deaths ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, there is an end of all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and triumphs; they confine all their care and heat to cocker and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a ſubſiſtence here, and when they come to die all their debts are paid.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170008:166"/> What ſtupid ignorance are moſt men infatuated with, to ſuppoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe death gives them a diſcharge of their life, it ſhould therefore give them a diſcharge of their ſins? Let ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate ſinners conceive, that death immediately will clap up their ſouls in everlaſting darkneſſe, and at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection their ſins ſhall drag their worme-eaten bodies from the gaol of the grave to receive the ſentence and doome of a miſerable eternity; and <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 26.</note> they ſhall finde death, not to be the diſcharge, but the beginning of their debt, and that it ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them into ſuch purſevants hands, <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 28.</note> as will be plucking them by the throat to all eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Others look on death as the grave of all their troubles, the very <hi>exit</hi> of all their perplexities; they wait for the <hi>good time,</hi> and do imagine that after <note place="margin">

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170008:166"/> they ſhall goe to bed, and to reſt in their winding ſheet.

Sin to a wicked man is like a tormenting diſeaſe to the poor helpleſſe patient, which will not be inchanted with good words, but will be at the heels of death, as the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Gods wrath, to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul immediately, and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite it to everlaſting loſſe and miſery. Theſe deluded ſinners, who ſuppoſe that death will crucifie all their troubles, and obliterate all their calamities, doe but take up their reſt in a ſhadow, death ſhall not rocke their ſouls aſleepe, though it caſt their bodies into a temporary ſwoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Others look on death, as a <hi>thing of courſe,</hi> and they cry, we muſt all die ſooner or later.

And is this all, deluded Sinner? It is true, when the <hi>Modus moriendi, the way of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is ſtrange and prodigious, then greater impreſſions are made; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the thing it ſelf is but the ſubject of a talkative diſcourſe.

               <p>In a word, let us ralley up the follies of moſt men into theſe foure ranckes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſick patient, he cries out for death, to take him out of the furnace of his torment, that his diſeaſe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:170008:167"/> and diſtemper may be at an end. But let me tell the Patient, if he is ſick of ſin, death will be a bad Phyſitian, it will heighten his diſeaſe: turne the rod into a Scorpion, will turn the mild ſoft diſtemper, imagine it in the higheſt torture the Patient undergoes, into a miſcellany of all torments, let them be boyld to the height.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The diſcontented ſinner, whoſe diſappointments and loſſes in the world fill him with agonies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, he hanging upon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> ſtretches out his armes to embrace death, and ſuppoſeth that it will eaſe him of all his pangs and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but fond ſinner, death to the wicked, is but a Goale delivery, and how fretfull wilt thou be, when thy ſoul ſhall be diſappointed to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the old, decrepit, bed-rid ſinner, whoſe body is a common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitall; who hath a bundle of diſeaſes, and a ſyſteme of diſtempers about him, who hath more diſeaſes then veins; ſo that if <hi>Galen</hi> had loſt any diſeaſe to treat on, he might finde it in him; he courts and cals for death, and waits
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170008:168"/> for one <hi>iſſue</hi> more, among all the reſt, an <hi>iſſue</hi> out of the world. But doth ſuch reumatique, flegmatique, decrepit, fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique ſinners ſuppoſe death will be a crutch to keep them from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell? Surely thoſe diſeaſes which attend nature in the ſocket, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion of it, if grace have not cured them, death ſhall turne them into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable maladies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And the tired worldling who hath gone himſelf out of breath in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of world affaires, he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death as a quiet and retired chamber to reſt in. But let ſuch a one conſider, if in all his purſuites he hath not followed an intereſt in Chriſt, and made that the object of his ſweat, he ſhall take up his lodging in a bed of <hi>eternall flames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not to amplifie the argument fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Death doth not ſtrangle the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or ſtiffle the Saint, but only ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them both over to eternity.

               <p>And firſt let us obſerve what death is to a believer.</p>
